			<p>Hi, thanks for visiting! </p>
			<p>My love and passion for drawing began when I was young. I was intrigued by how time would fly quickly when I would draw. I also loved seeing my creations on my paper, after spending a couple of hours drawing.</p>
			<p>My favourite aspect of drawing is how I can "capture" a picture and draw it to turn the picture into my point of view, using my imagination and interpretation.</p>
			<p>I am currently working in the animation industry while illustrating children`s books on the side. My goal is to take part in a good children's book that is educational and I hope they find my artwork interesting and fun to look at.</p>
			<p>I feel grateful and happy whenever I am able to use my creativity, and I would like to continue to pursue a path that requires creativity. </p>
